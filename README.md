#### This is a plugin for https://www.tinymce.com/ that allows you to insert accordions into the editor.


#### To use this plugin, add the name accordion to your plugins array upon tinymce init and then add it to whichever toolbar you'd like it to live on. 

### After clicking on the button it will prompt for a number. It will parse this number and output the desired amount of bootstrap accordions.
